<h2>Micaela Reyes</h2>
<p>Mickey is a freelance Python/Django Dev and co-founder and Trustee of Python.PH. She’s a big fan of Dicta License and believes that life is indeed “more than just eating, breathing and accumulating”--it’s cheesy but there’s no point denying it. She’s also a strong advocate of women in tech and called to arms a rare group of idealistic women through PyLadies Manila. (Fun fact: They're mostly INTJs and they actually think you could pick-up good relationship advice from The Zen of Python!)</p>
