The phrases and sentences used in the design of software applications, websites, and hardware can radically change how people engage with the technology.<br><br>Microcopy consists of the headings, hint texts, placeholders, summaries, and instructions throughout a website or app.  These small pieces of content often get overlooked—to the detriment of the application or website you are building. And yet it is one of the ingredients that make the difference between tech that fades into obscurity and extremely successful products like Trello or Slack.<br><br><b>What you'll learn</b><br>At the end of this 2.5 hour workshop, you'll understand the power of microcopy through many real-life examples and  learn how to analyze microcopy for strengths and weaknesses, identify opportunities to use microcopy, and practice writing some microcopy.<br><br><b>Who Should Attend?</b><br>If your team is building an app, website, or hardware with a user interface, and you want to learn how to give your product an edge using the wonders of words, then this workshop is for you—whether you're a designer, manager, writer, developer, or marketer.<br><br><b>Pre-requisite knowledge</b><br>Basic knowledge apps or websites like the concepts of screens and pages."
