<h2>Claudine Rodriguez</h2>
<p>Claudine usually has her mind wandering, thinking about ideas on how to solve problems from the mundane to the ambitious. She ties those mental loose ends by making things through Apparently, a studio she cofounded (one of their projects include Good Code, a pop-up coding school). On weekdays, she works as a UI/UX designer for Havas Ortega.</p>
