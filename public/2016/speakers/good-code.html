<h2>Gode Code</h2>
<p>Good Code is a pop-up coding school that aims to spread the word on the awesome and meaningful things computer programming can do. At the heart of Good Code is creating an environment for people to embrace coding literacy for improved learning approaches and, hopefully, a better chance to find job opportunities in the future.<br><Br>Good Code was inspired by the Hour of Code global movement (Hello, Mr. Partovi!). Our dream is to teach code in remote areas where programming or computer science courses are not part of the regular school curriculum.</p>
